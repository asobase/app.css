# app.css
The common app.css I put in each project. Constantly changing over time, but sick of digging through to find my most recent project to copy it over from. It uses a two-tone monochrome-esque aesthetic, but it's easy to extend since it's just css variables.

Intended for use with [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize). E.g.

```
import 'modern-normalize.css';
import 'app.css';
```

It also uses [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif), which is available from Google fonts
